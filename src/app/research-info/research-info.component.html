        <b>1. Testing Endogeneity of Spatial Weights Matrices in Spatial Dynamic Panel Data Models </b> (<em>Job market paper</em>) <br>
        Abstract: We propose Robust Rao’s Score (RS) test statisic to determine endogeneity of spatial weights matrices in a spatial dynamic panel data (SDPD) model (Qu, Lee, and Yu, 2017). We firstly introduce the bias-corrected score function since the score function is not centered around zero due to the two-way fixed effects. We further adjust score
functions to rectify the over-rejection of the null hypothesis under a presence of local misspecification in contemporaneous dependence over space, dependence over time, or spatial time dependence. We then derive the explicit forms of our test statistic. A Monte Carlo simulation
supports our analytics and shows nice finite sample properties. Finally, an empirical illustration is provided using data from Penn World Table version 6.1.

        <b>2. Evidence and Strategy on Economic Distance in Spatially Augmented Solow-Swan Growth Model</b> <br>
        Abstract: Economists’ interests in growth theory have a very long history
        (Harrod, 1939; Domar, 1946; Solow, 1956; Swan 1956; Mankiw, Romer,
        andIil, 1992). Recently, starting from the neoclassical growth model,
        Ertur and Koch (2007) developed the spatially augmented Solow-Swan
        growth model with the exogenous spatial Iights matrices (W). While
        the exogenous W assumption could be true only with the geographical/physical distance, it may not be true when economic/social distances
        play a role. Using Penn World Table version 7.1, which covers
        year 1960-2010, I conducted the robust Rao’s score test (Bera, Dogan,
        and Taspinar, 2018) to determine if W is endogeonus and used the
        maximum likelihood estimation (Qu and Lee, 2015). The key finding
        is that the significance and positive effects of physical capital externalities
        and spatial externalities (technological interdependence) in Ertur
        and Koch (2007) were no longer found with the exogenous W, but still
        they were with the endogenous W models. I also found an empirical
        strategy on which economic distance to use when the data recently has
        been under heavy shocks of the worldwide financial crises during year
        1996-2010.

        <b>1. Moral Hazard on Productivity Among Work-From-Home Workers Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic</b> <br>
        Abstract: After the outbreak of COVID-19, Firms appear to monitor Work-From-Home (WFH) Workers more than ever out of anxiety that Workers may shirk or do moral hazard at home. In this paper, I examine if Workers’ ex-post moral hazard induced by the unexpected shock on Firm’s value really exists and investigate its specific aspects and implications. Based on the statistical strategies, Worker’s productivity is differentiated by the two types and two-stage regressions to find the ex-post moral hazard on each type are implemented. Interestingly, the ex-post moral hazard among the WFH Workers is generally found to be significant although the significances vary by the type of Firms’ different policies on continuing WFH. Moreover, the advantages and challenges for the WFH culture are found that Workers with a health or disability issue are revealed to improve their productivity, whereas certain conditions to be productive in the WFH environment are needed. Findings in this study would help Firms to better understand the facets of Workers’ ex-post moral hazard by the productivity type and make appropriate policies to resolve issues accordingly. Furthermore, Firms may consider keeping the WFH culture or not by their purpose after the pandemic comes to an end. <br>
