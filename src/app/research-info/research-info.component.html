        <b>I. Research Interest</b> <br>
        · My primary research field is <em>Spatial econometrics</em>. For theory, I develop tests for various types of spatial econometrics models. Particularly, I'm interested in modeling dependence structures that explain the endogeneity of spatial weights matrices (W) and testing whether W is endogenous. For empirical studies, I find various types of (economic) distances, other than predetermined physical ones, which effectively construct W and hence capture the spatial effects in a more valid and comprehensive manner. <br>
        <br>
        · My secondary research field is <em>Socioeconomics</em>. I'm interested in identifying unobserved or underlying variables that determine humans’ economic behaviors or affect lifetime outcome in various features. I use quantitative approaches on predicting the latent measures through the scope of econometrics and statistics. Notably, I study social capital in multidimensional aspects: the dynamics in investing in social capital, the effect of social capital in employment, or spatial interactions of social capital with one’s neighborhood. <br><br>
            <br><br>
        <b>II. Research Goals & Expected Contributions</b> <br>
	    · I aim to develop <em>computationally efficient</em> tests to determine the endogeneity of W as well as tests for spatial dependences which is robust to any types of W, even to endogenous W for various spatial economic models. I believe my research contributes to Spatial econometrics in that it would help researchers to yield valid inferences when using a more generalized form of W, constructed by both physical and economic distances, with less computational cost than any other tests. Also, it would help researchers to find the presence of spatial dependences in a valid manner, despite of the potential risk of W being endogenous. <br>
	    <br>
        · Moreover, I believe that my empirical research on developing various kinds of distances that effectively construct W would help Spatial econometrics to be broadened as a general scheme in Social Sciences in studying the effects of human interactions. Together with my secondary field, I want to implement interdisciplinary studies with other disciplines in Social Sciences to interpret their own concepts on human interactions into a specific type of distances via Spatial econometrics framework. I believe that this project would lead to more richer and comprehensive understandings on the effects of human interactions on their economic behaviors. Furthermore, it may give practical insights for industry sector to capture network effects of consumer interactions.

        <b>III. Summary for Thesis Chapters 
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eazrtu34DDTxwG1IS-9NaSxh-HOBJko4/view?usp=sharing" style="color: pink">(Collected Abstracts)</a>
        </b> <br>
        <em>Chapter 1. Testing Endogeneity of Spatial Weights Matrices in Spatial Dynamic Panel Data Models</em><br>
        - <u>Motivation</u>: Even though conventional uses for the spatial weights matrices (W) in Spatial econometrics have been found in the predetermined geography, one may allow W to include economic distances, following the accumulating evidence in economics literature. However, this may lead to the violation of the exogenous assumption on W may not be valid anymore and inferences from the ordinary spatial autoregressive (SAR) estimators and test statistics will be invalid if there exists dependence between disturbance terms of the outcome and the economic variables that construct W. Testing the endogeneity of W is therefore important as a basic work for analysis due to the potential problem of W being endogenous when economic distances are effective in constructing W. For this purpose, I propose the Robust Rao's Score (RS) test to determine endogeneity of W, particularly in the spatial dynamic panel data (SDPD) models.
            <br><br>
        - <u>Highlights</u>: <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The Robust RS test is computationally efficient in that it only requires maximum likelihood (ML) estimators under the joint null, reducing the SDPD models to the simple fixed effects model. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) A Monte Carlo simulation shows that the Robust RS test has nice finite sample properties in size and power.

        <em>Chapter 2. Evidence and Strategy on Economic Distance in Spatially Augmented Solow-Swan Growth Model</em><br>
        - <u>Motivation</u>: Economists’ interests in growth theory have a very long history. Recently, starting from the neoclassical growth model, Ertur and Koch (2007)  developed the spatially augmented Solow-Swan growth model with the predetermined spatial weights matrices (W), driven by plenty of evidence about spillover effects across countries or cross-country externalities. However, the physical proximity does not necessarily lead to more economic interactions, as the knowledge spillover effects through economic interactions have been found empirically significant. Hence spatial interactions could be more valid to depend on both the economic variables as well as the predetermined geography. For this purpose, I investigated how the results in Ertur and Koch (2007) would become different if the exogenous W assumption is violated or more generalized to include economic distance.
        <br><br>
        - <u>Highlights</u>: <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) If the dataset is extended from year 1960-1995 (Penn World Table version 6.1) to year 1960-2010 (Penn World Table version 7.1), which covers the worldwide financial crises in late 1990s through 2000s, physical capital externalities as well as spatial externalities that were found positive and significant in Ertur and Koch (2007) are no longer detected. However, an endogenous spatial weight matrix (W) consisting of both the geographical and economic information could capture those externalities still positive and significant. This implies that an exogenous W is not robust to capture the spatial interaction effects if some abnormal shocks occur since the physical distance is invariant and not affected by the change in economy. Economic variables, however, are closely synchronized to a shock and therefore have inherent information regarding the economic shocks. This implies economic distances meaningfully construct W. 
	    <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Moreover, an empirical strategy on which economic distance to use depends on the feature of data: if the data recently has been under heavy economic shocks such as the global financial crises (year 1960-2010, Penn World Table version 7.1), the power distance weights function worked well. Otherwise, the negative exponential function worked well and gave similar results as those with the exogenous W (year 1960-1995, Penn World Table version 6.1).
	    <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Another finding is that an endogenous W is scale-sensitive with respect to the physical/geographical weights matrices (W_d) since the way the effect of economic distance spreads out may differ by the characteristics of the physical distance such as slope, curvature, or any other geometric properties. Hence one needs to carefully decide an appropriate Wd that best fits the feature of the economic variable in case the interpretation in magnitude of the externalities parameters matters.

        <em>Chapter 3. Social Capital and Workers’ Job Prospects in the MENA Region</em><br>
        - <u>Motivation</u>: While the Arab Spring and the notorious nepotism in Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) labor markets put spotlight on social networks and social media mobilizing them, little is known about MENA workers’ social capital. Driven by this, we investigate workers’ employment outcomes as a function of the social capital dimensions. The main challenge, however, is that social capital is unobservable, and its empirical measurement depends on how we define it conceptually. We construct the weighted index of individuals’ latent value of this variable using the Gaussian mixture model by Bayesian clustering as proposed by Franzen (2006) , a model-based non-hierarchical clustering technique based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to define the (dis)similarities in individuals’ profiles of socializing (social network, or trust, respectively), and identify patterns in data. We employ this model because this technique is more advantageous than the usual model-based clustering using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms in recovering the parameters of mixture models. We then estimate the effect of the social capital index on workers’ employment outcomes using the ordered-probability regressions.
        <br><br>
        - <u>Highlights</u>: <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Social activity levels are associated with creative occupations, higher-value social networks, with autonomous but less creative jobs, and trust with non-autonomous, manual, routine jobs.
	    <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Creative jobs spearheaded by the Fourth Industrial Revolution favor workers with higher socializing levels but inhibited social networks and trust.
