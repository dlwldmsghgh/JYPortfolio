        Abstract: I propose Robust Rao’s Score (RS) test statisic to determine endogeneity of spatial weights matrices 
        in a spatial dynamic panel data (SDPD) model (Qu, Lee, and Yu, 2017). I firstly introduce the bias-corrected score function 
        since the score function is not centered around zero due to the two-way fixed effects. I further adjust score
        functions to rectify the over-rejection of the null hypothesis under a presence of local misspecification in contemporaneous 
        dependence over space, dependence over time, or spatial time dependence. I then derive the explicit forms of our test statistic. 
        A Monte Carlo simulation supports the analytics and shows nice finite sample properties. 
        Finally, an empirical illustration is provided using data from Penn World Table version 6.1.

        Abstract: Economists’ interests in growth theory have a very long history (Harrod, 1939; Domar, 1946; Solow, 1956; Swan 1956; Mankiw, Romer, and Weil, 1992). Recently, starting from the neoclassical growth model, Ertur and Koch (2007) developed the spatially augmented Solow-Swan growth model with the exogenous spatial weights matrices (W). While the exogenous W assumption could be true only with the geographical/physical distance, it may not be true when economic/social distances play a role. Using Penn World Table version 7.1, which covers year 1960-2010, I conducted the robust Rao’s score test (Bera, Dogan, and Taspinar, 2018) to determine if W is endogeonus and used the maximum likelihood estimation (Qu and Lee, 2015). The key finding is that the significance and positive effects of physical
        capital externalities and spatial externalities (technological interdependence) in Ertur and Koch (2007)
        were no longer found with the exogenous W, but still they were with the endogenous W models. I also
        found an empirical strategy on which economic distance to use when the data recently has been under
        heavy shocks of the worldwide financial crises during year 1996-2010.

            Abstract: The Arab Spring and the notorious nepotism in Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) labor markets put spotlight on social networks and social media mobilizing them. Little is known, however, about MENA workers’ social capital. We propose gauging dimensions of social capital – activity levels of socializing, social networks and trust – using Bayesian clustering, and estimate ordered-probability regressions of workers’ employment outcomes as a function of the social-capital dimensions. Using the 2000–2014 World Values Surveys for 16 MENA countries, we find that social activity levels are associated with creative occupations; higher-value social networks with autonomous but less creative jobs; and trust with non-autonomous, manual, routine jobs. Creative jobs spearheaded by the Fourth Industrial Revolution favor workers with higher socializing levels but inhibited social networks and trust.
