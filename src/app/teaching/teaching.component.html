        I believe that I finally learn while I teach. Even though I thought I knew something, I often realized that there was the other side that I had not seen before. I have enjoyed growing my knowledge together with students while I teach. 
        <br><br>
        <b>I. Teaching Assistant & Grader Experience</b><br>
        I have worked as a Teaching Assistant (TA) and Grader mostly for Statistics courses in Economics and Econometrics. As a TA, I was responsive to students’ questions and requests. The tools to interact with students were various: weekly discussion sections, in-person or online office hours, real time communication via emails, and any tools that I could communicate with students. I have given TA sessions to help students digest course materials by giving examples and solving problems together and illustrate how to use software programs for Econometrics work. I also have given comments on students’ homework and exams and answered students’ follow up questions on them. Moreover, I mentored some students about specific and detailed advice on their academic interest and future career path, kindly responding to their requests. Some of them sent me warm-hearted Thank-you letters, which was very touching to me.
        <br><br>
        <b>II. Course Design</b><br>
        I’m qualified to teach Statistics in Economics and general topics in Econometrics. I have years of experience and knowledge for these subjects. I can teach both introductory classes and advanced courses. For introductory classes, I’ll basically focus on developing intuition by providing motivation from data and illustrating various real world examples. I also may possibly introduce the currently ongoing topics in the field. For advanced courses, I may teach theoretical- or programming-oriented courses depending on students’ preferences. For students who want to go onto graduate school, I’ll focus on proving theorems and train students to develop mathematical techniques. For students who want to have a job in the industry sector, I will provide materials oriented to applications and train students to get familiar with software programming. Other than this, I want students to have affection and find their potential interest in Econometrics. For this purpose, I will let students do their own research project as an extra credit work. Students may summarize literature in their interest or present their own research project. Also, I can invite two to three speakers to give a general mentoring for students’ career path regarding Statistics in Economics and Econometrics.
        <br><br>
        <b>III. Teaching Strategies</b><br>
        As a general teaching framework, I will let students digest the materials taught in class by doing weekly assignments, which gives credits only by submission so that students are motivated to review materials every week. Solutions are of course provided so that students could learn where they went off the track and utilize office hours for questions. Moreover, I’ll set pop quizzes online every other week and two to three exams, to assess students’ learning and reduce students’ digestion cycles for course materials. I’ll hold long office hours and operate real time Q&A board online so that students find it easy to resolve their questions whenever they need as much as possible. My key scheme for interaction with students is “Be there when they need me” and I’ll cordially follow my words. 
        <br><br>
        I hope students may find their joy in studying Econometrics and reading the world via Econometrics framework. I want to walk with students together as a senior student and be there when they need me.
