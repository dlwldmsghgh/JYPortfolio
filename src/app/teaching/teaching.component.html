        I believe that I at last learn while I teach. Even though I thought I knew something, I often realized that there was another side I had not seen before. I have enjoyed growing my knowledge with students. 
        <br><br>
        <b>I. Teaching Assistant & Grader Experience</b><br>
        I have worked as a teaching assistant (TA) and grader for statistics courses in economics and econometrics. As a TA, I was responsive to students’ questions and requests. The tools to interact with students were various: weekly discussion sections, in-person or online office hours, real-time communication via emails, and any tools I could use to communicate with students. I have held TA sessions to help students digest course materials by giving examples, solving problems together, and illustrating how to use software programs for econometrics work. I also provided feedback on students’ homework and exams and answered students’ follow-up questions. Moreover, I mentored some students and gave specific, detailed advice on their academic interests and future career path, kindly responding to their requests. Some of the students sent me warm-hearted thank-you letters, which touched me.
        <br><br>
        <b>II. Course Design</b><br>
        I am qualified to teach statistics in economics and general topics in econometrics. I have about 10 years of experience and knowledge in these subjects. I can teach both introductory classes and advanced courses. In introductory classes, I will focus on developing students’ intuition by providing motivation from data and illustrating various real-world examples. I also may introduce the current ongoing topics in the field. For advanced courses, I may teach theoretical- or programming-oriented courses depending on students’ preferences. For students who want to go to graduate school, I will focus on proving theorems and train students to develop mathematical techniques. For students who want a job in the industry sector, I will provide materials oriented to applications and familiarize students with software programming. Additionally, I want students to have affection and find their potential interest in econometrics. For this purpose, I will let students do their own research projects for extra credit. Students may summarize the literature about their interest or present their own research project. Also, I can invite two to three speakers to give a general mentoring session for students’ career paths regarding statistics in economics and econometrics.
                <br><br>
        <b>III. Teaching Strategies</b><br>
        As a general teaching framework, I will let students digest the materials taught in class by giving weekly assignments, graded only by submission so that students are motivated to review materials every week. I will also provide solutions so students can learn where they went off track and come to office hours with questions. Moreover, I’ll set up pop quizzes online every other week and two to three exams to assess students’ learning and reduce students’ digestion cycles for course materials. I’ll hold long office hours and operate a real-time Q&A board online so that students find it easy to resolve their questions. My key theme for interaction with students is “Be there when they need me,” and I will cordially follow my words. 
        <br><br>
        I hope students may find joy in studying econometrics and reading the world via the econometrics framework. I aspire to walk with students together as a senior student and be there when they need me.
