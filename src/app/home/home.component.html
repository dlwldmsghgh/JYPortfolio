    <div class="mat-body Biography">
        I’m <em>Jieun Lee (이지은)</em>, a Ph.D candidate in Economics in University of Illnois Urbana-Champaign. I own BA & MA & Ph.D (expected) degrees in Economics and two MS degrees in Statistics-Applied and Mathematics.
        <br>
        <br>
        My <em>main</em> research interest is <b>Spatial econometrics</b>. I develop estimators & robust score tests for various types of spatial econometrics models. Especially, I'm interested in modeling endogenous structure and testing endogeneity of Spatial weights matrices. I also work on finding spatial (spillover) effects in empirical studies. Currently, I’m working on three topics in this field: (i) Testing Endogeneity of Spatial Weights Matrices in Spatial Dynamic Panel Data Models; (ii) Robust Spatial Correlation Test in Spatial Dynamic Panel Data Models; (iii) Evidence and Strategy on Economic Distance in Spatially Augmented Solow-Swan Growth Model.

        My <em>secondary</em> research interest is <b>Socioeconomics (social economics)</b> and <b>Personnel economics</b>. For Socioeconomics, I'm interested in identifying unobserved or latent variables that determine humans’ economic behaviors or affect lifetime outcome in various features. I use quantitative approaches on predicting poverty & inequality measures through the scope of econometrics and statistics. Notably, I study social capital in multidimensional aspects:  the dynamics in investing in social capital, the effect of social capital in employment, spatial interactions of social capital with his/her neighborhood, or its spillover effects. Currently, I’m working on Social capital of Korean pre-retirees (tentative). For Personnel economics, I’m quite new to this field and trying to learn. I’m interested in capturing workers’ intrinsic motivations for economic behaviors or outcomes under certain working conditions, weighting more on econometrics perspective. Currently, I’m working on Moral Hazard on Productivity Among Work-From-Home Workers Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic.

        I'm also interested in <b>Data science</b> and open for Data scientist position. I enjoy learning the world through data!
